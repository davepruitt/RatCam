# RatCam

This program was designed to record videos during behavioral assessments of laboratory animals. The overall design is simple: you connect to a webcam, type the animal name, and press start! A configuration file does give you a few more options, including how long to record each video. The default duration is 3 minutes. 

The program was written using WPF and C#, and I used the AForge library to stream image data from connected webcams. Questions can be directed to David Pruitt.
